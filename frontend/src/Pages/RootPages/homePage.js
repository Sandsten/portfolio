			<p>Hello and welcome to my website!</p>
			<p>
				My bachelor is in{' '}
				<Link
					href="https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/TSVDK/20122/mal"
					text="Simulation Technology and Virtual Design"
				/>{' '}
				at <Link href="https://kth.se" text="Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan" />. Which sparked my
				interest for programming and graphics.
			</p>

			<p>
				My master's is in{' '}
				<Link
					href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/interactivemediatechnology/description-1.593765"
					text="Interactive Media Technology"
				/>{' '}
				where I focused on visual media. Taking courses in computer graphics, game design,
				information visualization and evaluation methods.
			</p>

			<p>
				For{' '}
				<Link href="https://staffansandberg.com/projects/masters-thesis" text="my thesis" /> I
				wanted to explore Virtual Reality a bit further, since I had only briefly used it previously
				in one of my courses. Therefore I found a topic where I had to create a driving simulator
				for electric vehicles in VR. In order to test a range critical situation using two different
				dashboards.{' '}
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time I enjoy playing classical guitar, video games, reading books and learning
				new things in general. One newfound interest is{' '}
				<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf" text="Disc golf" /> which I find very
				enjoyable and meditative.
			</p>
			<p>
				On this site you can see different projects that I've been a part of and blog posts about
				things I've learnt and want to share.
			</p>
			<p>You can find and contact me here:</p>
