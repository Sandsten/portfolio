			<h1>Whining home appliances</h1>
			<p>
				Why do we have washers? To make washing clothes easier and faster. Why do we have
				microwaves? To make heating up food easier and faster. Theses functions are without a doubt
				essential for most people in modern society. Without them, less time could be spent doing
				other things we find more enjoyable. So in other words modern home appliances are nice tools
				to have to makes our lives a bit more comfortable.
			</p>
			<p>
				One aspect which can be seen as quite annoying is that most of these devices is using a
				quite high pitch beeping sound as soon as they are done with their task. It's a very
				effective method for notifying the user that their food is done our that their clothes are
				done washing, but it adds annoyance. Our microwave beeps four times once it's done, and it
				will continue to beep every minute until you've opened the door. This becomes quite annoying
				if you're doing something else in the kitchen at the moment and the microwave keeps on
				whining until it's satisfied.
