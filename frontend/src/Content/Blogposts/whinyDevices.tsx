                Why do we have washers? To make washing clothes easier and faster. Why do we have microwaves? To make heating up food easier and faster. Theses functions are without a doubt essential for most people in modern society. Without them, less time could be spent doing other things we find more enjoyable. So in other words modern home appliances are nice tools to have to makes our lives a bit more comfortable.
